# Week1Challenge

What was the challenge?
  To make sure that basic user story criterias are met (to be able to view movies, all times, screen locations and book appropriate seating)
How I expected the challenge to go.
  This would require the following stages
  -Agile setting to analyse data
  -Take each task and make into a smaller tasks
  -Assign tasks to various teams
  -Test the cases, based on all three USER, ADMIN, and STAFF STORIES
What went well?
 -Working together as a TEAM, thats the most important thing. 
 -Once I understood the criteria, I tried to look at the perspective of different types of USERS with different needs or requirements.

What didn't go as planned?
  -I took too much on board in on go, tried to look at it collectively
  -Thought it was a coding challenge, and was looking from that perspective
  -Need to refer back to QA resources and remebember the importance of Agile methodology
  -Got to obsessed with USER stories, rather than actually allocate time to other aspects, like ADMIN area
Possible improvements for future challenges.
-Not to overcomplicate what the criteria is
-spend extra time learning from the QA acadmey, and familiarise with GIT academy.
